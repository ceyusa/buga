Another blogging utility
========================

1. I love git
2. I love emacs
3. I enjoy blogging
4. I like rst
5. I know python
6. I hate web editors

This is a set of scripts and git hooks that converto to HTML rst files
and then publish or delete them as blog posts using the MetaWeblog RPC API.

NOTICE: Right now I file all the blog post under the "General"
category. If you want to use another category, you should modify the
scripts/blogit script

WARNING: in order to map the filename <-> postId I decided to rely in the
git commit message mangling. Be sure of not add a line with the format
"filename: "

BIOHAZARD: I have only tested it for add an remove blog posts and one
commit per file, no modifications, neither multiple files per commit
have been tested.

DEADLY: I have only tested this code in my blog, which uses a custom
xmlrpc code, so I don't know if all these can work in other kinds of
blogs.

CONCLUSION: if you are a coward, avoid this.

Configuration
-------------

Edit your .git/config file and add something like

[blog]
        uri = http://my.blog/blog/XmlRpc.php
        username = username
        password = ubberpassword

And now hook the git post-commit hook:

cd .git/hooks
ln ln -s ../../scripts/post-commit.hook post-commit
